# ClassConnect

ClassConnect app allows users to connect with the teacher of a class and with other parents.
It provides a communication platform for parents and teachers to ask/answer questions about
the classroom and to discuss child's progress in the class.

The teacher can post details on what happened in the class, post a photo of the best work
board, recognize student achievements, or a clip from the spring program. They can also
post reminders of homework due, upcoming class or school events.

Parents can post questions to everyone in the group and any other parent or the teacher can
respond. Parents can also post a message to the teacher privately and have a private dialog
with the teacher. Private dialogs are not visible to other parents.

This is an app designed to bring parents and teachers together and bridge the communication
gap.
